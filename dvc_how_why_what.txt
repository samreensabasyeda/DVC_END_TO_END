DVC (Data Version Control) is an open-source version control system for machine learning projects. 

It helps manage:
>>>Data files (datasets, large files),
>>>Machine learning models (binary output),
>>>>Experiments, and
>>>>>pipelines in a Git-like manner.
>>>> data versioning and rollbacks to old versions
